## Oh, hello there.

Welcome to my new website. Truth be told, I have had this idea many times, and my personal life has interrupted me from taking the time to bring it to life. About 2 years ago, I put together a design in Figma that I was happy with. However, looking back, the design had a lot of things that needed to be adjusted. I reworked the design, and now in 2024, I had every intention of actually taking the time to build the site. Originally, it was going to be hosted on a .io domain, but with those apparently now imploding according to thew and others, I am sure glad I picked up this domain instead. For the design of the site, I decided to go with the classic black and green theme that may look as cliché as that is.

I am a big fan of serif fonts too, and you see them everywhere. Occasionally, I will browse the Google Font repository and look out for new fonts. A typeface category that I have started to fall in love with is mono fonts. There is just something about them. So retro, yet so stylish; they have this look that I can't get over. For the new site design, I chose IBX Plex Mono; and I absolutely love it.

## What’s under the hood?

We live in a JavaScript world now. I opted to use Next.js because it is one of my favorite frameworks and has many great features such as SSG, SSR, Image Optimization, etc. When I wrote the original version of this post, I’d opted to use Hetzner. As much as I enjoy tinkering with servers, I decided to retire that idea and stick with using serverless through Vercel. I just can’t get over all of the nice features they offer along with a very generous free tier. The upload to GitHub and instant deploy is just too good. I am also using CloudFlare for DNS and routing. At some point, I will host other experimental projects on the flakenstine.dev space too!

### Open Source!!!

I have made my website completely open source. You can find the source code on my Github - here [Github](https://github.com/flakenstine/flakenstine.dev). I am also using a few open source libraries such as Shadcn/UI and TailwindCSS.
